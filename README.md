# Interactive DnD Map
> An interactive DnD Map for my party that allows them to bring life and history to the map as we play.

## About
![Cover art](coverart.png)

This project was made to create a interactive map for my group of friends i play DnD with. It combines a JavaScript library called [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) with a easy to read/write json database. It will mainly be used and edited by my party but others may clone the project to suit their needs.
